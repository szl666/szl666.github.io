<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am Dr. Zhilong Song, currently a Junior Research Fellow at the Department of Advanced Materials, Suzhou National Laboratory, working under the supervision of Prof. Jinlan Wang and Prof. Qisheng Wu. My research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence and materials science, focusing on developing computational frameworks for automated materials discovery. I have contributed to research on three main topics: (1) inverse generation algorithms for functional materials design, (2) materials-specific large language models for synthesis prediction and scientific formula discovery, and (3) interpretable machine learning for catalyst design. My interdisciplinary work has led to the development of several innovative frameworks including MAGECS for electrocatalytic alloy design, SSAGEN for crystal structure generation, CSLLM for synthesizability prediction, and LLM-Feynman for universal scientific formula discovery.

I have published 16 peer-reviewed SCI papers with an h-index of 10, receiving total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3MkXEhUAAAAJ&hl'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>. Among these, I am the first author on 7 papers, including 3 in Nature Communications, 1 in Materials Horizons, 1 in Advanced Functional Materials, and 1 in The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters. Additionally, I have three important first-authored manuscripts currently under review, available as preprints. My research has achieved significant breakthroughs in automated inverse materials design, substantially improving discovery efficiency and success rates for novel functional materials.
