I am Dr. Zhilong Song, currently a Junior Research Fellow at the Department of Advanced Materials, Suzhou National Laboratory, working under the supervision of Prof. Jinlan Wang and Prof. Qisheng Wu. My research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence and materials science, focusing on developing computational frameworks for automated materials discovery. I have contributed to research on three main topics: (1) inverse generation algorithms for functional materials design, (2) materials-specific large language models for synthesis prediction and scientific formula discovery, and (3) interpretable machine learning for catalyst design. My interdisciplinary work has led to the development of several innovative frameworks including MAGECS for electrocatalytic alloy design, SSAGEN for crystal structure generation, CSLLM for synthesizability prediction, and LLM-Feynman for universal scientific formula discovery.

I have published 16 peer-reviewed SCI papers with an h-index of 10, receiving total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3MkXEhUAAAAJ&hl'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>. Among these, I am the first author on 7 papers, including 3 in Nature Communications, 1 in Materials Horizons, 1 in Advanced Functional Materials, and 1 in The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters. Additionally, I have three important first-authored manuscripts currently under review, available as preprints. My research has achieved significant breakthroughs in automated inverse materials design, substantially improving discovery efficiency and success rates for novel functional materials.

[Accurate prediction of synthesizability and precursors of 3D crystal structures via large language models](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-61778-y)

- Accessing the synthesizability of crystal structures is crucial for transforming theoretical materials into real-world applications. Nevertheless, there is a significant gap between actual synthesizability and thermodynamic or kinetic stability commonly used to screen synthesizable structures. Herein, we develop the Crystal Synthesis Large Language Models (CSLLM) framework, which utilizes three specialized LLMs to predict the synthesizability of arbitrary 3D crystal structures, possible synthetic methods, and suitable precursors, respectively. We construct a comprehensive dataset including synthesizable/non-synthesizable crystal structures and develop an efficient text representation for crystal structures to fine-tune LLMs. Our Synthesizability LLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (98.6%), significantly outperforming traditional synthesizability screening based on thermodynamic and kinetic stability. Its outstanding generalization ability is further demonstrated in experimental structures with complexity considerably exceeding that of the training data. Furthermore, both the Method and Precursor LLMs exceed 90% accuracy in classifying possible synthetic methods and identifying solid-state synthetic precursors for common binary and ternary compounds, respectively. Leveraging CSLLM, tens of thousands of synthesizable theoretical structures are successfully identified, with their 23 key properties predicted using accurate graph neural network models.
